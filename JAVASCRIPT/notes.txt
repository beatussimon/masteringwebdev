calcumations with floats are inaccurete the best practicvec is to do teh maths in cents and ten convert it back to dollars
rounding a number is putting to the nearest interger
38:00 rounding

Math.random()

how do you select the decimal places using the round function??
ceil and floor functions

Lesson 3:strings
- strings in javascript can be concairnated
- typeof tells you the number type
-javascript concairnates things from left to right so this expression '$'+0.44+50063 will result into $0.4450063 

The brackets can be used to control the order of operations
characters can be letters, numbers, symbol and escape characters "\"

"i'am the mother of her child"
"i'am the mother of her child"
"i'am the mother of her "child""
VM1193:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'child'Understand this errorAI
"i'am the mother of her \"child\""
`i'am the mother of her "child"`

\n - new line 

strings can be made wirth single, double quotes or backticks and the backticks have special meaning 
they are also called `...` = template strings interpolaion - lets you set a value directly into a string    
interpolaion is a recommended solution to the inserting techniques

backticks supports multiline strings


Lesson 04: HTML CSS review and console.log

HOW TO WRITE A SINGLE LINE COMMENT IN HTML AND IS IT DIFFERENT FROM CSS?? GOT IT /**/ IS FOR CSS


How to set up the waiting time between two events in web programming using javacript

lesson 05L variables
naming convections
camelCase
PascalCase
kebab-case
snake_case



know under what circumstances to use what type of variable and why
var way of declaration is ditched why? Findout
you can use typeof to check the type of a variable


Lesson 06: boolean statements


input element <input/> is a VOID element since it does not requore  closing tag
clicks and keydowns are known as events
onclick and onkeydown are known as event litseners

put event into a argument and hence acessible inside the function

you can convert a number into a string using String()

SPECIAL STRING BEHAVIOUR
Dont do math with numbers do math with strings

document object
window object:
javascripts add window. other things that we normally use in web programming automatically
window object represents the browser

LESSON 10: HTML, CSS and  JAVCASCRIPT together

LESSON 11- ARRRAY AND LOOPS
despite of a variable being a const its values can be changes usind  the index operator
myArray.splice() deletes an element from an array 
it takes two arguments first specifies the index and the secod specifies the number of items from that index should be deleted

myArray.splice(1, 4)


9:13:00

arrays like objects are references on assigning you just assign the copy and they all pint to the same memory location


Notice there is a difference between splice() -> deletes the elementse an array depending on the arguments you provides while slice() creates a new copy of an aray and gives the entirely new array which importantly points to the different memory location and hence can be manipulated independent of the old array you copied from

arrays can also be destructured

for instance 
const[firstValue, secondValue] = [12,45,56] the left vvariables will assgn each variable to the respective values in the right hand side


ACCUMULATOR PATTERN - > very importand in appending aitems both numbers and strings REMEMBER


LESSON !2: ADVANCED functions
just like variables functions are also values, this implies that functions can be saved inside the variables

on checking the typeof data it shows as function

Anonymous function- a function without a name

function greeting(){
    console.log("Hello!")
}
IS actially a shortcut for 
var greeting= function(){
    console.log("Hello")
}

Advantages of that syntax shortcut:
->Eacier to read

->Hoisting order of writing doesnt mateer like in normal function 

Method-> function saved inside an object 
This is called  to passin a functio to a function the function THAT WE ARE PASSING IN IS CALLED A CALLBACK FUNCTION OR CALL BACK

ASYNCHRONOUS CODE;
The computer wont wwait for a line to finish before going to the next line
SYNCHRONOUS CODE:
This means the compputer will wait for one line to finidh before going to the next line

by default the language is synchnronous but only when cetain features of javascript are used then the asynchronous ability is used for instance the FUNCTION setTimeout()
Its advantage is it doesnt block our code for the set time

setInterval(function we want to run in the future, time in milliseconds(and will keep running the code every 3 seconds))
those arguments are the same for the set interval and settimeout

9:56

10:00:00- finish lesson 11 and do all the exercises
done use a name of a function as an argument to another function not the functon notation



Lesson 12: Advanced functions part II
Arrow function
arrow functio has fewer parameter that normal function dont have 

awhen the function is one line you can remove the curly brackets and and automatically return the results

sometimes its very good to use regular functions b'se the enable hoisting and they are easier to read
In objects its advised tio use the shorthand method since its easier to read than using arrow function
for instance
randomObject ={
    key: name,
    method: ()=>{

    }, 
    method(){
        This one is easier to use 
    }
}

Add event litsener gives us the ability to run code when you interact with an element

so it the best way to interact with an element instead of onclick
add event litsrener enables us to add multiplle events for a single element 


10:20:00 add event litseners

2More array methods: .filter() => return a new array depending on the the values allowed in the return statement 
for example [12,22, 34].filter(value, (=>{
    return true /since it always returns true the new array will contain all the elements

    fi the return false; the new array wont contain any element

    return value>= 0 , return true if the values are greater than 0 and false if otherwise
})) 


the .map() aray method works like foreach and filter method the only differene id that the return value will be a value

for example 
[23,12,56].map((value,index)=>{
    return value*2;
})


CLOSURE - in javascript it means if a function has an acess to a value  it will always have acess to that value
=> value gets packaged together(enclosed) with the function
finish the exercises of chapter 12 understand the improvements made to the RPS and TOdo list apps and make sure you are able to do them

do the exercise 12x
map() will return array based on the returned value 
10:58; continue with exercise 12n

QUETIONS: If multiple classes are to be selected in an event fow is that  going to be accomplished if the event will select the first target it encounters with

LESSON 13: START TE AMAZON PROJECT AND INTRO TO GIT 

12:01: -cart.js make sure you finish today's lesson and study electronics(anorld)/database



Which product to add we are going to learn another feature callse data attribute- just another HTML attribute
->allows us to attach any information to an HTML element
Syntax rules for the data attribute:
follows the same syntax rules the attribute name on the left and attribute value on the RHS
data attribute have to start with a "data-" and then you can give it any name you want make sure you separate a name with a dash(-) and theis is known as kebab case 





The MAIN ideo java is:
    save the data
    Generate HTML
    Make it interactive
Finish the exerciss in 12:27:13

LESSON 14: MODULES

sCRIPTAGS DOES:
COMBINE ALL THE FILES INTO 1 BIG FILE
rUN ALL THEH CODE
 But using script tags can cause naming conflicts -> having varibles with the same name

 GETTING A VARIABLE OTSIDE THE MODULE:
 ->add type ="module" attribute
 ->export
 ->import

 in order for modules to work we need:
 to put the import line at the top, secondly you need to use live server
 when you import the variable and there is another variable having the same name you can counter this by import {cart as cartArray} from "filepath"
 this can make sure the naming conflicts are resolved

 The scriptTAG that loads our javascript into our site is called an ENTRY POINT



 Import can import multiple things from a file    
 
 import * as imports everything from a file and groups it together inside the object cartModule and then we can acess each import as a property or a method
 example:
 import * as cartModule from 'filepath';
 cartModule.cart
 cartModule.addToCart('id)

 we keep the functions that up[date the webpage in their main files]

 For instance the code that was left in the cart.js manages the cart while the amazon.js manipulates the webpage

 CHECKOUT:
the attribute type='model' enable module features for the module for the scr="specified file" so the specified file can import from other javascript files

when you use a part of the data to obtain the information about the related data is called de-duplicating the data or normalizing the data



For modules it is neccesary to include ./ or ../ to show the directory youo are with in

using modules can reuse our code and reduce repetition

finish the last 3 parts



15: External libraries, MVC, Finish the checkout page
gENERALLY WE LOAD THE External libraries first then we can use them in our PROJECT
Even on adding the external library to make the library a module you need to make the module an ESM version,
that implies that you will just add export at the beginning of the functionas we used to do in the previous javascript code to make modules
default expoert eg. impost dayjs from 'module'
the named export eg. import {sayHello} from "module"

Generally we load the library first then we can load our libraries in our cde below

Best practice in programming in javascript if you want to do something complicated find the library first before writing your own code

each file can have 1 default default

named export vs default export


Main idea of javascript:
->Save the data
->Generate HTML
->Make it interactive

The technique that we use that we:
->we updated the data then
->generate all the HTML is called
MVC: Model View Controller
Model- saves and manages all the data so in our project all the code that saves our code in our data folder is called the model

VIEW:
this is the code that takes our data and displays on the page
in our project if we open checkout.js all the code that takes the data and generates HTML is called the View

CONTROLLER:
This runs our code when we interact with the page

model->View->controller->model  keeps happening in a loop
****We use MVC to make sure that the page always matches the data
MVC is known as the design pattern

15:15 refactor the getdelivery function to work propery





16: Testing
Disadvantages of manual testing:
->Hard to test the code in every situation
->Hrd to retest

Automated testing
->Using code to test code
2-types of test cases:
basic test cases: tests if the code is working eg. in the code he just tests a normal number to see the thing is working
 Edge cases: tests the values which are tricky they are the edge of what our code can handle

 Try to test something diffrent in each test case
 Automated test make it easier to retest our code even when we make changes to our code

 On naming the tests the name should describe what the test is doing, the naming convention that is used is to describe what the code is doing

 group of related tests is callled a test suite


 Testing framework:
 ->external library that helps us write tests easier
 ->you can use describe inide describe
in jasmine specrunner.html is the ssame as tests.html in our previous files
spec===test

You can use describe inside describe for aesthetic reasons and arrange your code properly

16:20 -continue asmine testing diff func

The best practice in testing is to test each if condition of an if statement This is known as TEST COVERAGE => This means how much of the code is being tested (try to maximize the test coverage)

fLACKY TEST : A TEST THAT SOMETIMES PASSES AND SOMETIMES FAILS  even if we dont change the code 

MOCKS: a mock lets us replace a method with a fake version and then we can make the fake version do what we want

16:33 MOCKS

If the jdfile uses import you must add the type module 
spyOn function gives us the two things firs argument it takes is the object we want to mock and the second argument is the method we want to mock

It reads like english we are spying on local storage dot get item and call fake

A mock only lasts for 1 test

testing a single function : Unit test since we are testing a single piece of code

Intergration tests tests many units/ pieces of code working together

16:50 - intergration tests
In interfration tests we can test:
=>How the page looks
=>How the page behaves

A hook let us run code for each test:
before each hook

it not only that JASMINE provides us with different hooks beforeEach()-----> run code before each test
afterEach() ----> run code after each test
beforeAll() ----> run code before  all tests
afterAll( ------>Runs code after all tests)


Process that we do when we write code:
1.We make changes to our code 
2. Rerun the tests

17: Object oriented programming
17:37
The style of programming that we've been using is called procedural programming 
procedure: a set of step by step instructions
         : this is basically a function: we organixe our code into set of functins

In OOP we organize our code into objects

let cart; === let cart=undefined
Inside an object we can use the word expert or let to use it we should convert it into a property and value

Why use OOP:
-> OOP tries to represent the real world
->Easy to create multiple objects

For things that generate objects we use pascalCase as a naming conventions


EVEN BETTER WAY TO GENERATE OBJECTS:
-------------------------------------
=====================================
CLASS- is an object generator 

This is going to point to te object we generate
Each object we generate is an instance of the bject we generate

OOP- organizing our code into javascript objects(tries to represent the real world)

CLASS- helps us generate these objects

Benefits of classes:
->cleaner than using a finction
->classes have extra features for object-oriented -programming
1. => Constructor -> lets us run some setup code after creating an object 

constructor helps us put this code inside our class: 
{{{{{
    const cart = new Cart();
const businessCart= new Cart()

cart.localStorageKey = 'cart-oop'
businessCart.localStorageKey= 'cart-business'

cart.loadFromStorage()
businessCart.loadFromStorage()

console.log(cart);
console.log(businessCart); 
console.log(businessCart instanceof Cart)
}}}}}


consrtuctor  works like a normal method if we put come code inside it is gonna run it 
the special thing about the constructor is that if we generate thiis object 
 it will run this constructor automatically

More details about the constructor:
    IT HAS TO BE NAMED Constructor;
    SHOULD NOT RETURN ANYTHING FROM A Constructor

IF YOU HAVE A PROPERTY EQUALING UNDEFINED YOU CAN JUST LEAVE IT PLAIN:
    const PropertyName = undefined; is the dame as propertyName;


Class =>  better way to generate classes  in object oriented programming 

Making properties pricvate means they can only be acceses inside the class

#property -> this is a privee properly that can only be accesed inside the class

Without a hash ca property is called  A PUBLIC PROPERTY

A field is a PROPERTY

We also can have private methods
=>>just ass # at the beginning of the method to make it private

18:29 -working on our homepage
consverting regular objects into class, to visualizze this we have a regular object and we are wrapping it inside a class
and he reason we do this is that classes have extra feature we can use  we can:
we can add methods and private methods

INHERITANCE:
inheritance lets us reuse code between classes

we call the products the Parent class and the the clothing the Child class  

We use inheritance when 1 class is a more speciefic type of another class

super() calls the constructor of the parent class 
If we dont create the child constructor the child class qill by default run the parent constructor

How do we know which of our products are products are clothing we included type: Its is sometimes known as a discriminator property tells us which clss we should convert into 

Ehen you define the same method from the parent class inside the child class then its called mehod overriding since the parent method will be overridden/replaced

POLYMORPHISM: we can ise a method without knowing waht class it is

instead of using if else or ternary iperatir we can have the same method for both classes and the class itself will determine what the mothod does 
For instance if we add the appliance class we wont need to change any of the code in the HTML page since the Appliance class will determine what extraInfoHTML does


Testing class as an EXERCISE
BUILT-IN classes - classes provided by the language

this. feature lets an object access its own properties
In javascript this can be accesed anywhere in our code

at the point of acessing the inside **this the object has not been created yet!!  => 

If we are inside the object this will point to the object WHILE when we are outside the object there is nothing to point to and this will be undefined


The last place we can use this is inside the function;when you are inside an object this has nothing to point to hence its value will equal undefined However:
function logThis(){
  console.log(this)
}
logThis();
logThis.call('hello')

functions have a method called .call() .call() runs the function  except we can set the value of this to whatever we want 

.call is the same as running the function except when we are running the function we add a parameter infront this  parameter is the value of this 

Last important thing to know is that arrow function do not change the value of this
In arrow function this will have the same value as if it was outside which is undefined

Both inside foreach and foreach have the same value that was to resolve the iddue javascript had in the past where if this was inside the object and when had a function inside this had different value



18: Backends, callbacks, promises and async wait
A backend is just another computer that manages the data of the website
When two co,puters are connected to the the internet they can send messages to each other using the feature known as HTTP
in an HTTP message we can attach other information like our order

to send an HTTPrequest we use the built-in class known as XMLHttpRequest


import { renderOrderSummary } from "./checkout/orderSummary.js";
import { renderPaymentSummary } from "./checkout/paymentSummary.js";
//import '../data/cart-class.js'
import '../data/backend-practice.js'

renderOrderSummary()
renderPaymentSummary()

Messages will only appear in the network tab after we open the console, If we send some messages and then open the console it is not gonna show up 
To make surre our http messages are shown up there we need to open the network tab first and then we are gonna refresh the page and ressend those messages 

HEADERS => Gives info about the request or our message
RESSPONSE: After sending the request you get a response 
PREVIEW: takes the response and puts it in an easy to read format
Request-response cycle: Its is always 1 request, 1 response

the xhr.send() --> It is a asynchronous code as it jumps immediately to the next line of code it does not wait for that line of code to finish it sends the request and mmediately goes to the next line

19:49 wht set the eventlitsener first??

The urls path is the path that comes after the URL

The error message: Type, URL we sent it to, Status code

STATUS CODE:
Stars with 4 or 5 (400, 404, 500, Starting with 4 means it was our problem , starting with 5 it was the backends fault) => Failed
Starts with 2(200,201,204, ) => was succesiful

How do we know which url paths are supported => There is no speciefic way BUTTTT...
Some backends provide documentation page 

The list of backend paths which are supported is called backend API;
API -   application programming interface (interface means how we interact with something)

The backend can repond with different types of data(text, JSON, HTML, Image)

Once you get some JSON you can concert it to javascript object via JSON.parse()
This allows us to send the Javascript objacts across the internet to the backend

Instead of getting the raw data of the image it would be useful to get the real image, and WHEN we type a url in browserit actually sends a GET request to that URL
Using a browser is the same as getting the GET request
