order of precedence

calcumations with floats are inaccurete the best practicvec is to do teh maths in cents and ten convert it back to dollars
rounding a number is putting to the nearest interger
38:00 rounding

Math.random()

how do you select the decimal places using the round function??
ceil and floor functions

Lesson 3:strings
- strings in javascript can be concairnated
- typeof tells you the number type
-javascript concairnates things from left to right so this expression '$'+0.44+50063 will result into $0.4450063 

The brackets can be used to control the order of operations
characters can be letters, numbers, symbol and escape characters "\"

"i'am the mother of her child"
"i'am the mother of her child"
"i'am the mother of her "child""
VM1193:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'child'Understand this errorAI
"i'am the mother of her \"child\""
`i'am the mother of her "child"`

\n - new line 

strings can be made wirth single, double quotes or backticks and the backticks have special meaning 
they are also called `...` = template strings interpolaion - lets you set a value directly into a string    
interpolaion is a recommended solution to the inserting techniques

backticks supports multiline strings


Lesson 04: HTML CSS review and console.log

HOW TO WRITE A SINGLE LINE COMMENT IN HTML AND IS IT DIFFERENT FROM CSS?? GOT IT /**/ IS FOR CSS


How to set up the waiting time between two events in web programming using javacript

lesson 05L variables
naming convections
camelCase
PascalCase
kebab-case
snake_case



know under what circumstances to use what type of variable and why
var way of declaration is ditched why? Findout
you can use typeof to check the type of a variable


Lesson 06: boolean statements


input element <input/> is a VOID element since it does not requore  closing tag
clicks and keydowns are known as events
onclick and onkeydown are known as event litseners

put event into a argument and hence acessible inside the function

you can convert a number into a string using String()

SPECIAL STRING BEHAVIOUR
Dont do math with numbers do math with strings

document object
window object:
javascripts add window. other things that we normally use in web programming automatically
window object represents the browser

LESSON 10: HTML, CSS and  JAVCASCRIPT together

LESSON 11- ARRRAY AND LOOPS
despite of a variable being a const its values can be changes usind  the index operator
myArray.splice() deletes an element from an array 
it takes two arguments first specifies the index and the secod specifies the number of items from that index should be deleted

myArray.splice(1, 4)


9:13:00

arrays like objects are references on assigning you just assign the copy and they all pint to the same memory location


Notice there is a difference between splice() -> deletes the elementse an array depending on the arguments you provides while slice() creates a new copy of an aray and gives the entirely new array which importantly points to the different memory location and hence can be manipulated independent of the old array you copied from

arrays can also be destructured

for instance 
const[firstValue, secondValue] = [12,45,56] the left vvariables will assgn each variable to the respective values in the right hand side


ACCUMULATOR PATTERN - > very importand in appending aitems both numbers and strings REMEMBER


LESSON !2: ADVANCED functions
just like variables functions are also values, this implies that functions can be saved inside the variables

on checking the typeof data it shows as function

Anonymous function- a function without a name

function greeting(){
    console.log("Hello!")
}
IS actially a shortcut for 
var greeting= function(){
    console.log("Hello")
}

Advantages of that syntax shortcut:
->Eacier to read

->Hoisting order of writing doesnt mateer like in normal function 

Method-> function saved inside an object 
This is called  to passin a functio to a function the function THAT WE ARE PASSING IN IS CALLED A CALLBACK FUNCTION OR CALL BACK

ASYNCHRONOUS CODE;
The computer wont wwait for a line to finish before going to the next line
SYNCHRONOUS CODE:
This means the compputer will wait for one line to finidh before going to the next line

by default the language is synchnronous but only when cetain features of javascript are used then the asynchronous ability is used for instance the FUNCTION setTimeout()
Its advantage is it doesnt block our code for the set time

setInterval(function we want to run in the future, time in milliseconds(and will keep running the code every 3 seconds))
those arguments are the same for the set interval and settimeout
