order of precedence

calcumations with floats are inaccurete the best practicvec is to do teh maths in cents and ten convert it back to dollars
rounding a number is putting to the nearest interger
38:00 rounding

Math.random()

how do you select the decimal places using the round function??
ceil and floor functions

Lesson 3:strings
- strings in javascript can be concairnated
- typeof tells you the number type
-javascript concairnates things from left to right so this expression '$'+0.44+50063 will result into $0.4450063 

The brackets can be used to control the order of operations
characters can be letters, numbers, symbol and escape characters "\"

"i'am the mother of her child"
"i'am the mother of her child"
"i'am the mother of her "child""
VM1193:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'child'Understand this errorAI
"i'am the mother of her \"child\""
`i'am the mother of her "child"`

\n - new line 

strings can be made wirth single, double quotes or backticks and the backticks have special meaning 
they are also called `...` = template strings interpolaion - lets you set a value directly into a string    
interpolaion is a recommended solution to the inserting techniques

backticks supports multiline strings


Lesson 04: HTML CSS review and console.log

HOW TO WRITE A SINGLE LINE COMMENT IN HTML AND IS IT DIFFERENT FROM CSS?? GOT IT /**/ IS FOR CSS


How to set up the waiting time between two events in web programming using javacript

lesson 05L variables
naming convections
camelCase
PascalCase
kebab-case
snake_case



know under what circumstances to use what type of variable and why
var way of declaration is ditched why? Findout
you can use typeof to check the type of a variable


Lesson 06: boolean statements


input element <input/> is a VOID element since it does not requore  closing tag
clicks and keydowns are known as events
onclick and onkeydown are known as event litseners

put event into a argument and hence acessible inside the function

you can convert a number into a string using String()

SPECIAL STRING BEHAVIOUR
Dont do math with numbers do math with strings

document object
window object:
javascripts add window. other things that we normally use in web programming automatically
window object represents the browser

LESSON 10: HTML, CSS and  JAVCASCRIPT together

LESSON 11- ARRRAY AND LOOPS
despite of a variable being a const its values can be changes usind  the index operator
myArray.splice() deletes an element from an array 
it takes two arguments first specifies the index and the secod specifies the number of items from that index should be deleted

myArray.splice(1, 4)


9:13:00

arrays like objects are references on assigning you just assign the copy and they all pint to the same memory location


Notice there is a difference between splice() -> deletes the elementse an array depending on the arguments you provides while slice() creates a new copy of an aray and gives the entirely new array which importantly points to the different memory location and hence can be manipulated independent of the old array you copied from

arrays can also be destructured

for instance 
const[firstValue, secondValue] = [12,45,56] the left vvariables will assgn each variable to the respective values in the right hand side


ACCUMULATOR PATTERN - > very importand in appending aitems both numbers and strings REMEMBER


LESSON !2: ADVANCED functions
just like variables functions are also values, this implies that functions can be saved inside the variables

on checking the typeof data it shows as function

Anonymous function- a function without a name

function greeting(){
    console.log("Hello!")
}
IS actially a shortcut for 
var greeting= function(){
    console.log("Hello")
}

Advantages of that syntax shortcut:
->Eacier to read

->Hoisting order of writing doesnt mateer like in normal function 

Method-> function saved inside an object 
This is called  to passin a functio to a function the function THAT WE ARE PASSING IN IS CALLED A CALLBACK FUNCTION OR CALL BACK

ASYNCHRONOUS CODE;
The computer wont wwait for a line to finish before going to the next line
SYNCHRONOUS CODE:
This means the compputer will wait for one line to finidh before going to the next line

by default the language is synchnronous but only when cetain features of javascript are used then the asynchronous ability is used for instance the FUNCTION setTimeout()
Its advantage is it doesnt block our code for the set time

setInterval(function we want to run in the future, time in milliseconds(and will keep running the code every 3 seconds))
those arguments are the same for the set interval and settimeout

9:56

10:00:00- finish lesson 11 and do all the exercises
done use a name of a function as an argument to another function not the functon notation



Lesson 12: Advanced functions part II
Arrow function
arrow functio has fewer parameter that normal function dont have 

awhen the function is one line you can remove the curly brackets and and automatically return the results

sometimes its very good to use regular functions b'se the enable hoisting and they are easier to read
In objects its advised tio use the shorthand method since its easier to read than using arrow function
for instance
randomObject ={
    key: name,
    method: ()=>{

    }, 
    method(){
        This one is easier to use 
    }
}

Add event litsener gives us the ability to run code when you interact with an element

so it the best way to interact with an element instead of onclick
add event litsrener enables us to add multiplle events for a single element 


10:20:00 add event litseners

2More array methods: .filter() => return a new array depending on the the values allowed in the return statement 
for example [12,22, 34].filter(value, (=>{
    return true /since it always returns true the new array will contain all the elements

    fi the return false; the new array wont contain any element

    return value>= 0 , return true if the values are greater than 0 and false if otherwise
})) 


the .map() aray method works like foreach and filter method the only differene id that the return value will be a value

for example 
[23,12,56].map((value,index)=>{
    return value*2;
})


CLOSURE - in javascript it means if a function has an acess to a value  it will always have acess to that value
=> value gets packaged together(enclosed) with the function
finish the exercises of chapter 12 understand the improvements made to the RPS and TOdo list apps and make sure you are able to do them

do the exercise 12x
map() will return array based on the returned value 
10:58; continue with exercise 12n

QUETIONS: If multiple classes are to be selected in an event fow is that  going to be accomplished if the event will select the first target it encounters with

LESSON 13: START TE AMAZON PROJECT AND INTRO TO GIT 

12:01: -cart.js make sure you finish today's lesson and study electronics(anorld)/database



Which product to add we are going to learn another feature callse data attribute- just another HTML attribute
->allows us to attach any information to an HTML element
Syntax rules for the data attribute:
follows the same syntax rules the attribute name on the left and attribute value on the RHS
data attribute have to start with a "data-" and then you can give it any name you want make sure you separate a name with a dash(-) and theis is known as kebab case
